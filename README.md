# Human Face Classification Project

Welcome to our cutting-edge **Human Face Classification** project! This project is designed to efficiently categorize human faces into predefined classes, offering a seamless experience for users. 

## Overview

The project is divided into two primary components:

1. **Face Detection:** 
    - Utilizes advanced algorithms to accurately detect human faces within images or video streams.
  
2. **Face Recognition:** 
    - Employs state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to recognize and classify detected faces into pre-defined categories.

## Getting Started

### Train TensorFlow Model
- Utilize Google's Teachable Machine platform to train a TensorFlow model tailored to your specific classification requirements.

### Integration
- Import the trained model into the `test.py` file provided.
- Define class labels corresponding to the categories you want to classify faces into within the code.

### Execution
- Run the `test.py` file to activate the program.
- The program will access your webcam using OpenCV library tools.
- It will then identify your face's class in real-time and provide a matching percentage within that category.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
